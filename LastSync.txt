    ipq40xx: remove DK01 and DK04 boards
    
    DK01 and DK04 board support has been in a form of 2 patches that we have
    been carrying for a long time.
    Both of the patches contain weird changes, dont follow any DT syntax and I
    honestly doubt they are even valid.
    DK01 and DK04 also have not been converted to DSA even after a long time
    and I doubt that anybody in the community even has these boards as they are
    QCA reference boards that are not even obtainable anymore.
